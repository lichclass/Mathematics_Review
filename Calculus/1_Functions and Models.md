***Function Definition:***
> A function $f$ is a rule that assigns to each element $x$ in a set $A$ exactly one element, called $f(x)$, in a set $B$. i.e. **Function $f$ has rules that when you input $x$ from set $A$, it outputs exactly one element $f(x)$ from set $B$**

- set $A$ is called the **Domain** of the function
- The number $f(x)$ is the value of $f$ at $x$ (read as "f of x")
- The **range** $f$ is the set of all possible values of $f(x)$ as $x$ varies
- An arbitrary number in the domain of a function is called an **independent variable**
- A number that is represented in the range is called a **dependent variable**

***Determining if a graph is a function***
In determining if a graph is a function, we perform the **Vertical Line Test**. A curved graph is a function IF and ONLY IF no vertical line intersects the curve more than once.

***Piecewise defined functions***
**Ex. Absolute Value**
Definition. $|a| \geq 0 \text{ for every number } a$
$$
|x|=
\begin{cases}
x & \text{if } x \geq 0 \\ 
-x & \text{if } x < 0 
\end{cases}
$$
